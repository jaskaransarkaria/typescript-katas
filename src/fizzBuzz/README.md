# Fizz Buzz Kata

Suppose we have a number n. We have to display a string representation of all numbers from 1 to n, but there are some constraints.

*  If the number is divisible by 3, write Fizz instead of the number
*  If the number is divisible by 5, write Buzz instead of the number
*  If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 both, write FizzBuzz instead of the number
